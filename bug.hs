This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and infinite lists:

```haskell
import Data.List (intersect)

findCommon :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Maybe Int
findCommon xs ys = listToMaybe (xs `intersect` ys)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1..]  -- Infinite list
      ys = [1000..2000]
  print (findCommon xs ys)
```

The `intersect` function, due to Haskell's lazy evaluation, will attempt to traverse the infinite list `xs` even though a common element might exist within a finite portion of it. This can lead to a program that never terminates.
